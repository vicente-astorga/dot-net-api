# eCommerce + .NET Core 5 REST API

### A basic eCommerce website running on a REST API.

The backend works with a REST API based on the .NET CORE 5 framework (for requirements needs). The database was created in SQL Server Management Studio (18) for full compatibility.

The frontend is a simple website that allows users to simulate purchases (bypassing the payment process).
